# Olympic Analysis Dashboard

This project aims to provide an interactive dashboard using the Streamlit library to explore and analyze all the Olympics held up until now. The dashboard offers insights into various aspects of the Olympics, such as medal tally, country-wise performance, athlete-wise achievements, performance analysis, gender participation, and sports trends.

## Data Handling and Visualization Challenges

### Duplicate Data
One of the significant challenges in this project was dealing with duplicate data. Duplicate entries in the dataset can lead to inaccurate analysis results. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis, we implemented data-cleaning techniques to remove duplicate records from the dataset.

### Historical Issues
Historical data can often pose challenges due to changes in country names or other relevant information. To maintain data consistency and relevance, we carefully curated and updated the historical data, addressing issues like country name changes and other relevant updates.

## Key Analyses in the Project

### Medal Tally
The dashboard includes a comprehensive medal tally analysis that showcases the number of medals won by each country and athlete over the years. Users can visualize and compare the performance of different countries and athletes in various Olympics.

### Country-wise Analysis
We have aggregated and displayed the medal counts for each participating country across different Olympics. This analysis allows users to explore the dominance of certain lands in specific Olympic events.

### Athlete-wise Analysis
The dashboard shows individual athletes' medal achievements across different Olympics. Users can explore and compare the performances of their favorite athletes over time.

### Performance Analysis
The project includes an in-depth analysis of athletes' performances in different sports over time. This analysis helps identify trends and improvements in performance across various Olympic events.

### Gender Participation
We have explored and presented data on the participation of male and female athletes in different Olympics. This analysis sheds light on the progress of gender representation in the Olympics over the years.

### Sports Analysis
The dashboard provides insights into the popularity of different sports in various Olympics and their trends over the years. Users can explore how certain sports have gained or lost popularity in the Olympic games.
